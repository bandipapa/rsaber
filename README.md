Actually, any headset with OpenXR support + Vulkan API is supposed to work.

## Download

You can go to [releases](https://github.com/bandipapa/rsaber/releases/) to download pre-compiled binaries.

## Build From Source

If you prefer, you can compile rsaber from sources. First of all, you need to have [rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) installed.

### android

Prerequisite:
- Install Android Studio, then go to SDK Manager and install:
  - SDK Platforms -> Android 12L (API level 32)
  - SDK Tools -> NDK

- Setup rust toolchain, replace username and version as needed:
  ```
  rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
  cargo install cargo-apk
  set ANDROID_HOME=c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
  set ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\<version>
  set PATH=%PATH%;c:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr\bin
  ```

In the past, manual downloading of OpenXR Loader was needed, but it has been integrated in the build
process already.

Clone repo, connect Quest to PC, then build & run:
```
git clone https://github.com/bandipapa/rsaber.git
cd rsaber\android
cargo apk run
```

### pc

Build & run:
```
cargo install rsaber_pc
rsaber_pc
```

You can use keys w-a-s-d to move, z-x to change elevation, r to reset view and arrow keys to rotate camera.
Interaction with UI controls can be done with mouse.

### pcvr

Prerequisite:
- cmake is needed to build OpenXR loader, go to https://cmake.org/, and install it.

Build & run:
```
cargo install rsaber_pcvr
rsaber_pcvr
```

## TODO

- Saber<->note collision detection
- Linux port
- Have the option to dump/read assets from local files (this is for modders who don't want to recompile)
